# Wisielec:

### The program, which is an implementation of the game "hangman". 

### My code in the hangman game is for one user and the words that are contained in the list are randomly selected by the computer.

### Three functions have been contained in this code:


### - The first function does a simple thing just randomizes us a word.
### - The second function masks words and changes to lowercase letters (.lower) so that we can enter uppercase and lowercase letters.
### - Our last function that performs all our actions. Thanks to it, we determine the number of attempts by the user, thanks to the loop, when he can give a letter or guess the whole word.

# QUIZ:

### This program created a quiz.

### My code was created to test my programming knowledge
### At the beginning, we create global variables before the functions
### This program has four functions :

### - The first function is our main function that we display. We ask the user to choose the answer and we add them to our created table.
### - The second function checks if the answer is correct or wrong 
### - The third function prints us back to us and returns our answers which were correct and displays the result as a percentage at the end
### - the fourth function just asks if we want to play again(later, thanks to the while, this play again function works)
