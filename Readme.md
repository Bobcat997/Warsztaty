### The program, which is an implementation of the game "hangman". 

### My code in the hangman game is for one user and the words that are contained in the list are randomly selected by the computer.

### Three functions have been contained in this code
<span style="color: lime">

### - The first function does a simple thing just randomizes us a word
### - The second function masks words and changes to lowercase letters (.lower) so that we can enter uppercase and lowercase letters
### - Our last function that performs all our actions. Thanks to it, we determine the number of attempts by the user, thanks to the loop, when he can give a letter or guess the whole word
